Starting Data:

Age: (Average för kvinnor mellan 26-35 år är 73-76bpm)

Height: (Längre personer har lägre HR )

Weight: (Påverkar HR)

Do you consume alcohol regularly? (Yes/No) (Alcohol can increase HR and decrease HRV) (Al)

How often do you exercise per week? (0 / 1-2 / 3-4 / 5+) (Regular exercise can lower HR and increase HRV over time)

What type of exercise do you do most often? (Cardio / Strength / Mixed / None) (Cardio generally lowers HR and increases HRV, while strength training may temporarily increase HR)

On a typical day, how much caffeine do you consume? (None / 1 cup / 2+ cups) (Caffeine can increase HR and decrease HRV temporarily)

How would you rate your overall stress levels over the past week? (1-10) (Higher stress increases HR and decreases HRV)

Daily Updated: (Will be done while measuring)

Did you consume caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine in the last 2 hours? (Yes/No) (All can increase HR and decrease HRV)

Did you engage in physical activity in the last 2 hours? (Yes/No) (Recent exercise may temporarily increase HR but improve HRV over time)

How many hours of sleep did you get last night? (Less sleep can increase HR and decrease HRV)

How would you rate your sleep quality? (Poor / Fair / Good / Excellent) (Better sleep quality lowers HR and increases HRV)

Overtime Data: (Will be made in an application)

Compare your BPM readings over multiple days. Are they consistent? (Yes/No)

Are higher BPM readings linked to caffeine, alcohol, stress, or lack of sleep? (Yes/No)

Are lower BPM readings linked to relaxation, exercise routine, or better sleep? (Yes/No)

Do you notice changes in BPM based on time of day? (Yes/No) (HR tends to be lower in the morning and higher in the evening)

Do you experience unexpected fluctuations in BPM? (Yes/No), Why? (Sudden changes can indicate dehydration, illness, or stress)
